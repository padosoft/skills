# API security review

Ten checks to run **before committing** a change to an API, and when reviewing a PR. Each one carries the
mistake that produces it: these are failure modes that have been seen in production code, not items from a
generic checklist.

The complete rules, with identifiers and rationale, are in [`references/rules.md`](references/rules.md).
Read it when a check fires and you need the full reasoning, or when you have to decide whether something is
a real exception.

## 0. How to run it

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR | grep -E '\.(ts|js|mjs)$'
# empty? then: git diff --name-only
```

Apply the relevant checks to those files. **For every violation: block the commit**, name the rule, propose
the fix. Skip a check that does not apply to the diff — do not report it as passed.

**A pre-screen is a screen, not a verdict.** Each one is tuned to surface candidates, and a healthy codebase
still produces hits: they are the compliant implementations of the very rule being checked. Where that
happens, the check below shows what a compliant hit looks like — recognise it, say so in one line, move on.
A check that reports 40 lines every time gets ignored, and then it protects nothing.

Severity: a violation of checks 1, 2, 3 or 5 is **critical** — each of them is, on its own, enough to expose
data or credentials. The others block the commit but can be discussed.

---

## 1. Auth on every mutating route — `API-SEC-AUTH-001`

Every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE endpoint is authenticated, and every route group has an auth middleware.

```bash
# commented-out auth: this is exactly how three endpoint groups became public
grep -rnE '^\s*//\s*.*\.use\(\s*\w*[Aa]uth\w*' src/routes src/app
# wildcard auth inside a sub-app (see the flattening gotcha below)
grep -rnE '\.use\("\*",\s*\w*[Aa]uth' src/routes
```

- **A commented-out auth line is a critical bug**, never a temporary state.
- **Internal/debug endpoints are deleted, not gated.**
- **Authentication is not authorization.** A middleware that resolves "any valid user token" lets a customer
  through on a back-office endpoint. Staff-only routes need a **positive role check** after it.
- Prefer a **positive role allow-list** (`["SALES_ASSOCIATE","admin"]`) over a negative predicate ("has no
  customer row"): the negative form both under-blocks generic internal accounts and over-blocks hybrid users
  who are staff *and* customers.
- **Hono flattening gotcha:** when several sub-apps mount on the same prefix, `route.use("*", authMw)`
  **inside** a sub-app leaks to its siblings. Apply auth on the **exact path** where the app is composed.
  The grep flags every `use("*", …auth…)`, so before calling it a violation check the two things that make it
  one: **is the prefix shared** with other sub-apps, and **is it a gate**? A wildcard `optionalAuthMiddleware`
  on a sub-app with its own prefix is neither — it populates the context, it does not block.


**Audit every equivalent mutating route, not only the newest one.** When a second import, upload or
provisioning path exists for the same resource, the controls added to the one built last are routinely
absent from the one built first — and the old path is still wired. List the routes that mutate a given
resource and compare their middleware stacks side by side, rather than reviewing the one in the diff.

**A permissive cross-origin default on a control plane is an opening.** An administrative API that answers
with a wildcard origin while authenticating with cookies or credentials has given every site the ability to
act for a logged-in operator. Default to same-origin, allow exact configured origins, vary the cache by
origin, and reject a disallowed cross-origin state-changing request **before** the route handler runs.

## 2. Ownership from the authenticated id — `API-SEC-IDOR-001`

```bash
grep -rnE 'valid\("(query|json|param)"\)' src/controllers | grep -iE 'user|customer|client|order|receipt|return|device|lock|lease'
```

The owner id comes **only** from the authenticated context. Never trust an id from query/body/param for
ownership — scope the SQL to the authenticated id.

- A nested sub-resource with no owner column needs an **explicit ownership join**; "the parent was checked"
  is not a guarantee.
- An identifier is not a credential: a `device_id` or a `lease_token` proves nothing on its own. Bind the
  lease to `(token, expiry, resource, owner)` and verify it against the authenticated identity.
- On mutations: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, verify ownership **inside** the transaction, check `affectedRows`, and
  make a mismatch an **idempotent no-op / 404** — a distinguishable error turns the endpoint into an
  existence oracle.

## 3. No secrets or PII in responses — `API-SEC-SECRET-001`

```bash
grep -rnE 'FROM settings' src/query
grep -rniE 'select .*(password|secret|token|api_?key|private_key)' src/query
grep -rnE 'SELECT \*' src/query
```

**Why this rule is first:** a credential in a settings table is one public endpoint away from being handed
out. Settings are read by many callers and are the kind of table nobody re-reviews, so a key that lands
there is served to whoever asks — and a leaked deploy credential means someone else can ship your code.

- Secrets do not live in a settings table. Until they move to a key store, the runtime filter is the only
  barrier — and no endpoint may bypass it.
- **Allow-list the response fields.** Never return whole rows; mask credential columns to `null`. The
  `SELECT *` grep also hits derived tables (`SELECT * FROM ( … ) x`), which never reach the client: what the
  rule is about is the **projection returned to the caller**, not every star in the file.
- A **permissive allow-list is a trap**: combine an exact deny-list *with* name and value detectors. Do not
  "allow everything not explicitly secret".
- Strip identity fields from public projections and honour "hidden" flags **fail-closed**.

If the project has a secret classifier, three ordering rules are load-bearing (each one is a bug that already
happened — the details are in `references/rules.md`):

1. **The inclusion allow-list runs before the value scan**, otherwise a legitimate key that merely *looks*
   like a secret gets filtered and the safety belt becomes the outage.
2. **A name exemption is anchored to its own dot-segment**, otherwise an innocuous word anywhere in the key
   disarms the match everywhere — fail-open, and silent.
3. **Exclusions match exactly**, never as substrings.

Filtering is **never silent**: log every removal once per key with the deciding rule.

## 4. Logs and telemetry without secrets or PII — `API-SEC-LOG-001`

```bash
# 1. a secret named in the log call
grep -rniE 'logger\.(info|debug|warn|error)\(.*(token|cookie|authorization|password|session|email|JSON\.stringify\((headers|req|request|body|row))' src
# 2. an OBJECT handed to the logger — the case the first grep cannot see
grep -rnE 'logger\.(error|warn|info|debug)\([^)]*,\s*(err|error|e)\)' src \
  | grep -viE 'sanitize|redact|safeError|\.message'
grep -rnE 'console\.(log|error|warn|info|debug)\(' src --include=*.ts | grep -v '\.test\.ts'
```

Never log `Authorization`/Bearer, cookies, API secrets, tokens, passwords, auth bodies, or national id /
VAT / email. Log non-sensitive markers instead (`has_session_cookie=true`). No `console.*` in runtime paths.

> The invariants behind this check — and the fact that the redaction goes in a **different place** depending
> on the stack — are in **`padosoft-logging-discipline`**. Read it when the finding is about what ends up in
> a log line; what follows here is the API-specific part.

⚠️ **The second grep is the one that matters, and it is noisy on purpose.** Grep 1 reads the *message*; the
leak is usually in the *object*. Narrow it to the dangerous context — a `catch` around a database call:

```bash
for f in $(grep -rlE 'logger\.(error|warn)\([^)]*,\s*(err|error|e)\)' src); do
  grep -qE 'client\.execute|getConnection' "$f" && echo "$f"
done
```

**A driver error object carries the query already formatted, with the bound values substituted.** In mysql2
that is `err.sql`. So `logger.error("db lookup failed:", err)` on a query bound with `:tokenHash` writes the
token hash into the log — an equivalent of the token for anyone reading, enough to find the row in the token
table. And the branch that logs is the **failure** branch: exactly the one people open when something breaks,
copy into a ticket and paste into a chat.

Do not redact the whole thing — that makes the logs useless precisely when they are needed. Keep what
diagnoses (`code`, `errno`, `message` truncated) and drop `sql`, `sqlMessage` and the stack:

```ts
export function safeDbErrorDetails(err: unknown) {
    if (typeof err !== "object" || err === null) return { code: "UNKNOWN" };
    const e = err as { code?: string; errno?: number; message?: string };
    return { code: e.code, errno: e.errno, message: e.message?.slice(0, 200) };
}
```

*This is a real finding: the line existed, the previous commit had left it untouched, and its comment
declared it already safe.*

Telemetry: never export a **raw** query string, a client IP read straight from a header, or a raw exception.
Sanitize the query (redact credential-like keys, email-shaped values, blobs), truncate the user agent, and
replace exceptions with a neutral error **after** the handler has built the response, so the real status and
payload survive.

## 5. Environment gates must be fail-SAFE — `API-SEC-ENV-001`

```bash
# the PARSED value only: a raw process.env read is the correct form, do not flag it
grep -rnE '(^|[^.[:alnum:]_])env\.NODE_ENV\s*(===|!==)' src | grep -v 'process\.env'
```

If the env schema defaults `NODE_ENV` to `"development"`, a production deploy that simply **omits** it makes
every `env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` gate **fail-open** — debug output and mock auth in production.

```ts
// WRONG — fail-open when NODE_ENV is unset in prod
if (env.NODE_ENV !== "production") returnDebugInfo();
// RIGHT — fail-closed, from raw process.env; unknown counts as production
export const isNonProdRuntime = new Set(["development", "test"]).has(process.env.NODE_ENV ?? "");
if (isNonProdRuntime) returnDebugInfo();
```

Mock auth must **abort startup** unless the raw `NODE_ENV` is exactly `development`/`test`.

## 6. Bound SQL — `API-SEC-SQL-001`

```bash
# exclude the sanctioned forms, or the signal drowns: on a clean codebase the raw
# grep returned 89 hits, of which ~45 were generated placeholders and offsets
grep -rnE "(WHERE|SELECT|LIKE|VALUES|SET|ORDER BY)[^\n]*\$\{" src/query \
  | grep -viE '\$\{([a-zA-Z_]*[Pp]laceholders|ph|offset|safeOffset|limit)\}'
grep -rnE "'\\\$\{" src/query          # a literal '${x}' is injection too
grep -rn 'client.query(' src           # use the parameterized execute
```

Always named bound params. **A SELECT literal is injection as well**: `'${lang}' as lang` is a hole.

Narrow exceptions: `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` only if they are schema-coerced numbers; column name and sort direction
only through an allow-list plus a ternary; `IN (…)` through a placeholder builder — and **merge** the params
it returns.

**What a compliant hit looks like** — recognise it and move on, instead of re-investigating it on every
commit:

```ts
const sortCol  = SORT_COLUMN_WHITELIST[f.sort] ?? "bc.updated_at";   // ✅ allow-list + fallback
const orderDir = f.order === "asc" ? "ASC" : "DESC";                 // ✅ ternary, two outcomes
const op       = getDbOperatorByQueryStringOp(input.operator);       // ✅ mapper, not the raw string
sql += ` ORDER BY ${sortCol} ${orderDir} LIMIT ${f.perPage} OFFSET ${offset}`;
```

The three questions for a remaining hit: does the value come from the request? If yes, does it pass through
an allow-list or a ternary? If it is a number, is it coerced by the schema? Three yeses, it is fine.

⚠️ `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` are often interpolated **deliberately**: mysql2 does not bind them as named placeholders.
Do not "fix" one back into `:limit` — the query breaks. Check the coercion instead.

Adjacent correctness trap, same file: in a translation join, put the language filter **inside that join's own
`ON`**. On a second `LEFT JOIN` it cannot reduce rows — it only nulls the non-matching ones, so the query
returns N rows per source row. That inflates paginated responses *and* makes `rows[0]` without `ORDER BY`
return the translated row only sometimes: the bug filed as "sometimes it doesn't translate" that nobody
closes. With a single language both forms look identical, which is why it survives.

## 7. Structural resource caps — `API-SEC-LIMITS-001`

```bash
grep -rnE 'fetch\(' src | grep -viE 'signal|timeout|AbortSignal'
```

Every attacker-controlled collection, body, cursor, cache and outbound fetch needs an explicit cap **before**
the business logic runs. Reference values that worked: 16 MiB body, 100 items per batch (dedup first), 64 KiB
cursor with a mandatory expiry, 8 MiB response, 10s end-to-end fetch deadline held until the body is
consumed, bounded LRU + TTL for in-memory caches, recursion depth capped, stable `ORDER BY` with a max
`LIMIT` on paginated reads.

Per-identity rate limiting, if present:

- **Mount it after the route's auth**, so the bucket is the authenticated identity and not a shared NAT IP.
- Put the numbers in a **policy table**, not inline at the mount site: the policy name is part of the key, so
  a duplicate name silently merges two quotas.
- The PII-enumeration endpoint (a customer search) stays the strictest policy.
- A limiter that **fails open** when its store is down is a deliberate choice, not a bug: rate limiting is an
  availability control and authorization is upstream. Do not "fix" it to fail closed without a decision.
- Never log the identity value — log its *kind*. An IP is personal data.


**A process-local counter protects one process.** With more than one replica, the window has to be decided
by shared storage — serialised inside a transaction, or on a store that can make the decision atomically.
The in-process fallback is fine for development, and it does not support a claim about production. Key the
limit on the tenant or the credential, never on a client-supplied address header.

## 8. Injection into downstream consumers — `API-SEC-OUTPUT-001`

```bash
grep -rniE 'javascript:|vbscript:|data:' src/services src/repositories
grep -rnE '\.csv|text/csv|writeCsv|toCsv|join\(","\)' src
```

A stored URL that will later be rendered or redirected to: reject `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:`,
`file:`, protocol-relative `//host`, embedded credentials and CRLF — **on write and on read**. Rows already
in the database were written before the validation existed.

CSV: a cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` (also after whitespace or a BOM) is executed as a formula by
spreadsheet apps. Use an RFC 4180 encoder that neutralizes formulas; never hand-concatenate CSV.

## 9. No trust from caller input — `API-SEC-TRUST-001`

```bash
grep -rniE 'header\(\s*["'"'"']?(x-session-token|is_logged_in|cf-connecting-ip|x-forwarded-for|x-real-ip|x-client-ip)' src
grep -rniE 'etag|if-none-match|304' src/middlewares
```

- Privileged claims (audience, embargo, "is logged in") are **signed**, not query params: HMAC-SHA256 over
  timestamp + method + exact URL, short anti-replay window, timing-safe compare, fail-closed with no secret.
- An explicit `Authorization` header takes **absolute precedence** and never downgrades to an ambient session
  cookie.
- Read the client IP through **one helper**, from the single header your edge actually sets, and validate the
  charset. Behind a proxy that forwards, the hop-by-hop headers are the *proxy's* address. Even the right
  header is spoofable unless the origin only accepts traffic from that edge (mTLS or IP allow-list) — so
  per-IP limits are an obstacle, not a barrier.
- **An allowlist on the initial URL does not survive a redirect.** Disable automatic following, validate
  the destination against the same explicit allowlist, reject credential-bearing URLs, and surface the
  blocked response as evidence instead of silently following it.
- **Redirect safety is not name-resolution safety.** Re-checking the allowlist at send time and disabling
  redirects is necessary and is not protection against a destination that resolves inward; that belongs in
  a connection-aware egress layer, and claiming it from a portable client wrapper is claiming something you
  do not have.
- **When the caller is a browser you drive, constrain the whole context, not the navigation.** Validating
  the URL handed to a navigation call says nothing about redirects, subresources or form-triggered
  requests: install the network policy on the context before the page exists, and abort anything that is
  not allowlisted.
- Cache: default `private`/`no-store`; any `Authorization`/`Cookie` forces it. Evaluate `If-None-Match`
  **after** auth, never before — and derive the ETag from the body only once the handler has run.

## 10. Supply chain and build — `API-SEC-SUPPLY-001`

- Pin images and CI actions to a **digest/SHA**, never a floating tag.
- Build secrets through secret mounts; never write a token into a layer or a committed `.env`.
- Frozen, lockfile-exact production install.
- Distroless base, non-root, read-only runtime artifacts, deploy by immutable digest.
- Transport policy **fail-closed in production**: plaintext or unverified DB/cache/SMTP is rejected, not
  warned about.
- Do not add or widen a static-secret export in CI, and do not add a production deploy path with no approval
  gate.

---

## Gotchas

- **Grepping for the secret's name finds the wrong half of the problem.** The two real leaking lines were
  caught because their message happened to contain the word "token"; the same call with the message "db
  lookup failed" is invisible to that grep and just as dangerous. Check **what is handed to the logger**, not
  what the sentence says.
- **"It's behind the gateway" is not auth.** Every audit finding above was in a service someone believed was
  private.
- **A green test suite proves nothing here** if the tests are not mounted in CI. Check that the security
  tests actually run before trusting them.
- **Documentation that teaches the broken pattern reopens the defect.** When you fix instances of a pattern,
  fix the example in the project docs in the same PR, or the next query will reintroduce it.
- **Fix the form, not the instance.** Scan for the *shape* of the bug across the codebase (every `*_languages`
  join, every `fetch(` without a signal) rather than the one case the report named.
- **An exception is one line with a written reason**, in the allow-list — never a widened regex.
