  Use this skill when something is being declared done, safe, covered or production-ready and you need to
  know what actually proves it: a release or compliance gate, a security or DR claim, a "CI is green so we
  can ship", a "the job succeeded", a "the tests pass so it works", a coverage or mutation number, a signed
  artifact, an integration verified against an emulator or a mock. It names the claim, names what would
  prove it, and finds the gap where a cheaper artifact was accepted in place of the expensive one. Do not
  use it to write tests (padosoft-test-integrity), to build a CI workflow (padosoft-ci-workflow-gates), or
  to debug a failing check — this is about whether a passing one means anything.

# Evidence boundaries

Almost every false "done" has the same shape: a claim was made about the expensive thing, and a **cheaper
artifact** was accepted as proof of it. The artifact is real, it was produced honestly, and it does not
demonstrate the claim.

**The rule: name the claim, then name what would prove it. If what you have is cheaper than the claim, the
claim is asserted, not proven.**

---

## 1. The substitution table

The recurring pairs. Read the middle column as what you are entitled to say, and the right one as what will
be said anyway.

| What you have | It proves | It does **not** prove |
|---|---|---|
| A green run against an emulator or compatible implementation | the request/response shape | the real provider's identity, policy, retention, encryption |
| A static graph, topology or config validation | the transitions are **declared** consistently | that anything ever reached them |
| A write request the API accepted | the option was transmitted | that the provider applied it — read it back |
| A signature on a manifest | the manifest is authentic | the content the manifest points at |
| A digest field, a reference, a ticket id | something was **named** | integrity: nobody recomputed anything |
| Deployment files, linted and secret-scanned | they parse | that a scrape, an export or an alert works |
| An injected or faked client in a test | your control flow | the real storage, transport or locking semantics |
| A parsed report from an external tool | the tool ran and said something | that the finding is fixed, or safe to close |
| Exit code 0 | the process ended | that the effect happened |
| A declared number (coverage, score, RTO) | somebody wrote a number | that it was derived from this run |
| A skipped optional check | nothing | **less than nothing** — it reads as a pass |

The last row is the one that does real damage, because it is the only one that looks identical to success.

**When the claim sits in a specific domain** — storage and encryption, identity and access, telemetry,
queues and effects, supply chain and release, money and settlement, data protection — open
`references/rules.md` and read that one section: it lists the substitution offered in that domain and the
part of the claim it leaves untouched.

## 2. Six questions that turn an artifact into evidence

1. **Who produced it?** An artifact a contributor can regenerate locally proves a local fact. Release
   evidence comes from a protected producer.
2. **What is it bound to?** Commit, tool version, command, key identity, tenant, environment. An unbound
   report is a report about *something*.
3. **Is it verified again at read time?** Writing a digest at creation protects nothing unless the reader
   recomputes it and refuses on mismatch. Every consumer that turns records into a decision verifies first.
4. **What is the boundary of the claim?** One successful path is evidence for that path. It is not evidence
   for rotation, failover, logout, replication or the next tenant.
5. **Does it fail closed?** When the environment is incomplete, the run must refuse. A local skip is not
   production evidence, and a green skipped gate is worse than a red one.
6. **Could all of it be true and the system still be broken?** If yes, you have found the gap. Say what
   would close it, even if you do not close it today.

## 3. When one path hides another, prove each leg

An exporter accepting a span does not prove the metrics endpoint can be scraped, and a successful scrape does
not prove delivery downstream. Wherever a chain has independent legs, assert **each** one; a single end-to-end
"it worked" hides which leg is actually carrying the result — and which one has been broken for months.

Corollary: read **both** output streams when you assert on a tool's own diagnostics. A journey that watches
only stdout reports a false negative on a tool that writes its confirmation to stderr.

## 4. Keep the gates separate, or the cheap one decides

| Keep apart | Because |
|---|---|
| synthetic CI ↔ protected provider evidence | one is free and constant, the other is the truth |
| static validation ↔ live journey | a generated path can look complete with nothing observed |
| parsing ↔ gating | a parser that also decides hides its own failures |
| execution ↔ the report gate | a score becomes evidence only at an explicit boundary |
| the library contract ↔ the shipped command | a contract with no executable command is bypassed operationally |

Merging two gates does not average their strength; the weaker one becomes the verdict.

## 5. Evidence at rest

- **Canonical bytes.** Publish the exact bytes the hash was computed over. A convenience writer that re-runs
  formatting or redaction on the way out changes the content after the chain was built.
- **Strict field sets.** Canonicalising only the fields you know about leaves an unknown property that is
  still displayed to an operator and still consumed downstream — and is covered by no signature. Reject it.
- **Producer-executable canonicalisation.** If the producer cannot run the same normalisation the verifier
  runs, the two will disagree exactly when it matters.
- **Redaction must not mutate identity.** A DLP pass that rewrites a checkpoint key, a run id or an audit
  hash breaks the chain it was protecting. Identity fields are excluded by construction, not by luck.


### When the evidence is a signed record

Four invariants, each of which has been violated by a verifier that reported everything as fine:

- **Sign the whole persisted object**, minus the signature field itself. Signing only the fields you
  enumerate leaves the removal of a key, or the addition of one, invisible — and a verifier will then count
  an emptied record among the valid ones, certifying as intact a row somebody hollowed out.
- **Canonicalise deterministically**: sort maps recursively, leave lists in their order because there the
  order is the data, and normalise the container types before hashing, so the producer holding a native
  object and the verifier holding what came back from the parser compute the same bytes. A signature that
  is not reproducible generates **false tamper alerts**, which is the fastest way to get an integrity check
  switched off.
- **A missing signature is an anomaly, not an exemption.** If unsigned records can be explained away, the
  mechanism is bypassed by deleting two fields instead of forging one.
- **Deletion at the edges leaves no gap.** Removing the first or last records of a file, or the file
  itself, breaks no sequence. Detect it with an external anchor recorded **after** the write succeeds, and
  by checking that the last identifier of one period and the first of the next are adjacent.


## 6. Small ones, same class

- **A timing field that is merely below the objective can still be false**: derive elapsed time from trusted
  timestamps and reject disagreement, rather than trusting the number that was submitted.
- **A successful dump is not a restore.** The evidence is a fresh read from the restored copy.
- **A test file that exists is not a test that runs**: the manifest or script has to execute it.
- **A number derived from a filter is not a number derived from the run.** Coverage is derived, never
  declared.
- **"Verified locally" closes nothing.** A replay against a local fixture and a probe against the real system
  are different claims with different exit codes.

---

## Gotchas

- **The artifact is usually honest.** Nobody faked anything: the emulator really was green. The defect is in
  the sentence written above it, so review the *claim*, not the evidence.
- **Two weak proofs do not make a strong one** unless they are independent. Two checks reading the same
  fixture are one check.
- **The cheap gate runs on every push and the expensive one runs rarely**, so the cheap one silently becomes
  the definition of "working". Decide that on purpose, and name what the cheap gate does not cover.
- **Documentation goes stale into a risk.** A process document describing evidence that is no longer produced
  is worse than no document — see **`padosoft-docs-match-code`**.
- **An automated decision can be genuine without fabricating evidence.** Automating the verdict is fine;
  automating the *proof* is how a system starts certifying itself.

## Checklist

- [ ] The claim is written in one sentence, and what would prove it in the next
- [ ] Producer identity, and the bindings: commit, version, command, key, tenant, environment
- [ ] Read-time verification wherever a digest, signature or chain exists
- [ ] The boundary of the claim stated explicitly — including what it does not cover
- [ ] Incomplete environment fails closed; no gate can pass by skipping
- [ ] Independent legs asserted independently
- [ ] Cheap and expensive gates kept separate, and the gap between them written down
- [ ] Numbers derived from the run, never declared
- [ ] At least one honest "could this be true and the system still broken?"
