  Use this skill when changing a shared OpenAPI contract that other projects consume — adding or editing a
  field, an endpoint or a response schema in a spec package, or bumping and publishing it — and whenever the
  user says the mock and the real API disagree, a client method is missing a new parameter, the generated
  document fails to build, or a consumer broke after a spec release: it walks the places that must stay in
  sync (schema, mocks and per-tenant overrides, endpoint, client, tests), the changeset and version bump, and
  the build-and-call verification loop. Do not use it to implement the endpoint in the API that serves it
  (padosoft-hono-api-conventions) nor for its security review.

# OpenAPI spec workflow

In a spec-first repository the contract is published and **other projects depend on it**. A field added in
one place and forgotten in four others does not fail here: it fails in the consumer, after the release.

This skill is the sync list and the verification loop.

---

## 1. Before touching anything: what kind of change is it?

| Change | Bump | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| New optional field, new endpoint | **minor** | Keep working |
| Bug fix, mock or doc update | **patch** | Keep working |
| Field removed, type changed, field made required | **major** | **Break** — announce it |

Making an optional field required is a breaking change even though nothing is deleted. If you are about to
do it, say so before writing code: it is usually cheaper to add a second field.

## 2. The sync list

A change to a schema touches **more than one file**. Walk the list; the ones that do not apply, say so.

1. **The schema** — the type definition itself.
2. **The mock data**, including the **per-tenant overrides**. This is the step that gets forgotten: the
   default mock is updated, the per-client ones are not, and the client tests pass while one tenant serves a
   response without the field. Every mock carries the new field, **including optional ones**.
3. **The mock index/map**, when a file is added or removed — not when a field is added to an existing one.
4. **The endpoint definition**, so it points at the updated schema. Update the description too.
5. **The mock controller**, when it builds the response **by hand** instead of spreading the fixture: a
   manually built object silently drops the new field.
6. **The typed client**: a new query parameter must reach the method signature *and* its documentation.
7. **The tests**: cover the new field. If there is no test for that endpoint, write one.

## 3. Changeset and release

Every new feature, new endpoint or breaking change gets a changeset **before the commit**.

```markdown
---
"@scope/openapi-spec": minor
"@scope/api-client": patch
---

What changed, in one line that a consumer can read.
```

The changeset text ends up in the consumers' changelog: write it for someone who has not seen the PR.

## 4. Verification loop

Do not trust the build alone — a contract that compiles can still serve the wrong document.

```bash
# 1. build (this is slow: ask the user before running it)
bun run build

# 2. mock server in the background
bun run mock &

# 3. the generated document must actually serve
curl -fsS localhost:{port}/openapi.json | head -5

# 4. call the endpoint you touched and look at the field
curl -fsS "localhost:{port}/v1/{endpoint}" | grep -o '{new_field}'
```

Step 3 is the one that catches the real failures: the code compiles, and the document generation throws at
runtime.

## 5. Verify the commit contents

```bash
git show --stat HEAD
```

Compare the file count against what you expected to change. **`git add -A` silently skips files excluded by
`.gitignore`**, with no error and no warning.

*This happened:* a generic `logs/` pattern, written for runtime logs, swallowed a source directory named
`otel/logs/`. Build, server and tests were green locally; the files were simply absent from the commit, and
the endpoint did not exist for anyone else.

If files are missing:

1. `git status --short` and compare with the expected list.
2. `git check-ignore -v <path>` to confirm why.
3. If they are legitimate sources, add a **negation** to `.gitignore` (`!**/otel/logs/`). Do **not** use
   `git add -f`: it fixes this commit and leaves the trap armed for every future file in that folder.

## Gotchas

- **The per-tenant mocks are the ones that get forgotten.** The default one is right there; the overrides are
  in another folder.
- **A mock controller that builds the response by hand** drops new fields without failing anything.
- **A "literal" path segment is not a version.** When a path segment is fixed by an external standard (the
  `/v1/` of the OTLP protocol, a webhook path a provider calls), it does not migrate with your API version.
  Write it down next to the route, or someone will "fix" it during the v2 migration.
- **Mounting a route with an empty path string is not the same as `"/"`.** One of the two produces a doubled
  slash in the generated document or in the route index, and the mismatch surfaces far from the cause. Decide
  which one each layer wants, and comment it.
- **Lenient in the request, strict in the response.** An invalid optional input (a bad language code) is
  treated as absent and resolved by the server fallback — never a 422 caused by that field alone. The same
  field in a response stays strict: the documented contract does not bend.
- **A schema wrapper that swallows errors is not introspectable.** A "catch"-style wrapper hides the
  underlying type from the document generator and the build fails with an unknown-type error: declare the
  type and enum metadata explicitly, so the generated document is identical to the strict one.
- **Ask before the full build.** It is slow, and the user often has more edits queued.

## Checklist before committing

- [ ] Bump level decided (major/minor/patch) and breaking changes announced
- [ ] Schema updated
- [ ] Default mock **and** every per-tenant override carry the new field
- [ ] Mock index updated (only if a file was added/removed)
- [ ] Endpoint points at the updated schema, description current
- [ ] Mock controller returns the field (check if it builds the object by hand)
- [ ] Client method and its docs updated for new parameters
- [ ] Tests cover the new field; created if absent
- [ ] Changeset written, readable by a consumer
- [ ] Build + mock + real call verified
- [ ] `git show --stat HEAD` matches the expected file count
